# GKS ASHG 2024 Unconference

Welcome to the repository for GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards (GKS) Unconference.

We will be hosting a unconference as an ancillary event at
[ASHG](https://www.ashg.org/meetings/2024meeting/) on Monday, November 4th, 2024 from
8 AM - 4 PM. The location is at the Hyatt Regency Denver at Colorado Convention Center
in room Mineral A. This repository will contain project proposals from registered
unconference participants.

## Participation Application and Selection

Due to the limited number of spaces, we require all interested participants to fill
out [this](https://forms.gle/DE7sMXLUCzHQhaJx6) application form. Only those who
complete the form will be eligible to participate. Spots will be allocated on a 
first-come, first-served basis, so please submit your application ASAP to secure your
spot. You will be notified via email within 1-3 business days if you've secured a spot.

## Project Proposals

To propose a project, please submit your idea using our
[GitHub issue template](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-ashg-2024-unconference/issues/new?template=project-proposal.yaml).
We encourage you to submit your proposal ASAP so others have a time to review your
proposal before the event.

Check out the repository
[proposal tracker](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-ashg-2024-unconference/issues)
and express your interest in proposed unconference projects with
[reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
on the top-level comment. If you want to see a proposed project clarified or otherwise
revised, add a comment to the issue and get a discussion going!

## Proposal Selection

Each proposal will have 1-2 minutes at the start of the unconference to give a brief
brief pitch. After the pitches, we will break off into smaller groups to focus on the
proposals that generate the most interest and engagement.
